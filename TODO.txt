###
# What Works:

- basic types
- structs
- vectors
- vector of structs
- c++, python, matlab
- binary i/o for C++, Python and Matlab
- fixed length arrays

###
# What doesn't:

- ascii i/o

###
# Other todos:

- all types: handle empty vectors when reading and writing
- combine c++ and c into single header/c file
- combine c files by "namespace"
- use "namespace" in python file names
- cleanup default value handling
- cleanup cpp_type handling
- cleanup stream_type handling
- io_support.c - add inlines
- add "is_flat"?
    - time full struct write compared to packed binary write
- GPB support plan
- ascii i/o support? json i/o support?
   - flat vectors to flat output
- auto-generate a set of tests
- should default length be supported?
